# ng-esbuild-tests

Run Angular 2+ unit tests faster!

### Note
This repository is a result of my experiments with `esbuild` and `TestBed`.
If you want to read about my process, you can find it in the articles:
- [esbuild against TestBed](https://mythical-angular.dev/posts/jest/)
- [It looks that TestBed works with esbuild](https://mythical-angular.dev/posts/ngc-esbuild-jest/)
- [Short: I had some time, so I checked how time-consuming is TesBed](https://mythical-angular.dev/posts/testbed-time/)

This repository contains experimental code and **shouldn't be used on CI or production.** 

But feel free to copy my code and create your own tools.

## Know issues

I use a very basic configuration, so it might not be able to compile your code.
I was able to run it on standard nx/ng code generated by the CLI. 

I found also that running it from the project directories may cause conflicts between `jest` versions.
